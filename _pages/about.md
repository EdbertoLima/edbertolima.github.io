**Edberto Moura Lima**

Hi there! I am a Junior Scientist with a specialization in the sustainable use of natural resources. My expertise includes forest science, climate change, ecohydrology, soil physics, and landscape planning and management. My research primarily focuses on understanding how sustainable land-use practices can mitigate human impacts on the environment while enhancing agricultural productivity in the context of climate change.

### Expertise

- **Environmental Sustainability**: Soil and water management, ecosystem restoration, climate resilience.
- **Hydrological and GIS Modeling**: Expertise in SWAT modeling, GIS applications for environmental planning, and water yield assessments.
- **Data Analysis**: Advanced statistical modeling, spatial data management, and root cause analysis.
- **Climate Adaptation and Land Use**: Sustainable agricultural practices, land-use modeling, and climate adaptation strategies.
- **Project Management**: Coordination of project timelines, workflows, and quality control in hydrological and environmental projects.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Collaboration with international and local entities, including NGOs and government agencies, for capacity building and policy development.
- **Field Experience**: Soil data collection, LiDAR data analysis, and ecosystem monitoring.
- **Teaching and Training**: Developing and delivering courses, supervising graduate students, and creating educational resources.
- **Software Development**: R-based applications for data analysis and project tracking.

### Computing Stack

- **Programming**: 
  - Proficient in R (e.g., `ggplot2`, `knitr`, SWAT-related packages).
  - SQL.
  - Knowledge of Python (e.g., `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`).
- **GIS and Remote Sensing**: 
  - Skilled in ESRI software, Google Earth Engine, QGIS, and LiDAR analysis.
- **Web Development**: 
  - Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Statistical Analysis**: 
  - Regression analysis, multivariate analysis, and general linear models.
- **Hydrological Tools**: 
  - Advanced use of SWAT and land-use modeling frameworks.
- **Operating Systems and Automation**: 
  - Linux command-line tools, Git, and process automation with CI/CD pipelines.
- **Project Tools**: 
  - Workflow management in Agile environments and scientific documentation using RMarkdown or similar tools.
