I am a Junior Scientist with a specialization in the sustainable utilization of natural resources. My expertise encompasses forest science, climate change, ecohydrology, soil physics, as well as landscape planning and management. The primary focus of my research is to comprehend how the implementation of sustainable land-use practices can alleviate anthropogenic impacts on the environment while simultaneously enhancing agricultural productivity in the context of climate change.

Furthermore, I possess extensive experience with well-known ecohydrological and semi-physically based models, such as SWAT, SWAT+, and APEX, which are indispensable tools for simulating watershed processes and land management practices.
