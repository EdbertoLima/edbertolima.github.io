  Edberto  Moura  Lima  is  a  doctoral  student  in  Forest  engineering  under  the  supervision  of Professors  José  Miguel  Reichert  at  Universidade  Federal  de  SantaMaria  (UFSM).  Edberto graduated from Universidade de Brasília witch bachelor’s degree in Forest engineering in 2016; He received his master’s degree in Forest engineering in 2018 through the Programa de Pos-Graduação  em  Engenharia  Florestal  da  Universidade  Federal  do  Paraná  (UFPR).  His  main  field of  work  has  been  nature  conservation  and  restoration  of  degraded  areas.  Previously,  Edberto conducted  research  studies  on  the  conservation,  management  and  use  of  the  Cerrado, prioritizing  understanding  the  ecological  relations  between  species  and  environment.  Lately, He has took effort to incorporate the social component and its relationship with the landscape, in  order  to  propose  actions  mitigating  the  impact  caused  by  the  use  and  exploitation  of  the land, aiming at the conservation of ecosystems and the rational use of natural resources. Part of his current research focus is to investigate how forest fragmentation affects the dynamic and quality of water at small catchments. Besides Edberto’s knowledge of forest ecology  and management, his background education includes ability to work with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and programming languages such as Visual Basic and R. On his free time, Edberto enjoys  short  stroll,  read,  watch  sci-fiction  series  and  when  is  possible  play  RPG  games.  His current  interests  include  the  studies  of  forest  fragmentation,  pedology,  hydrology,  modelling, landscape dynamic and forest management in small catchments.</p>
